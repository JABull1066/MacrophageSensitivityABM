# MacrophageSensitivityABM
Code associated with "Quantification of spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity in an agent-based model of tumour-macrophage interactions" (Bull and Byrne, 2022)


Running this code requires installation of the open source Chaste (Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment) software, available at https://www.chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/. This repository contains additional code required to run the main simulation executable, Exe_2022_RunSimulation.cpp. This executable can be called with the following command line arguments, which alter the parameters of the simulation:


- "ID" - ID string for the simulation
- "ACCD_T" - averageCellCycleDuration_Tumour: Average cell cycle duration for tumour cells ($\tau_{tum}$)
- "ACCD_S" - averageCellCycleDuration_Stroma: Average cell cycle duration for stromal cells ($\tau_{str}$)
- "CS_M2CSF" - chemotacticSensitivity_macrophageToCSF: chi value for macrophage chemotaxis sensitivity to CSF ($\chi_{c}^{m}$)
- "CS_M2CXCL12" - chemotacticSensitivity_macrophageToCXCL12: chi value for macrophage chemotaxis sensitivity to CXCL12 ($\chi_{\xi}^{m}$)
- "CS_TC2EGF" - chemotacticSensitivity_tumourCellToEGF: chi value for tumour cell chemotaxis sensitivity to EGF ($\chi_{\epsilon}^{T}$)
- "MPI" - macrophagePhenotypeIncrementPerHour: amount to increment macrophage phenotype by each hour when above TGF threshold ($\Delta P$)
- "DTBV" - distanceToBloodVessels: initial distance from tumour cells to blood vessels ($R_{B}$)
- "NOBV" - numberOfBloodVessels: target number of blood vessels to include in the simulation ($N_{B}$)
- "HMECSF" - halfMaximalExtravasationCsf1Conc: concentration of CSF1 at which the extravasation rate will be half maximal ($c_{1/2}$)
- "MPOE" - maximumProbOfExtravasationPerHour: maximum rate of extravasation from a blood vessel ($P^{\star}$)
- "TGF_TFPS" - tgfThresholdForPhenotypeSwitch: TGF threshold above which macrophage will begin to polarise ($g_{crit}$)
- "IT" - Iteration Number

# Simulation outputs visualised in Zegami
We use Zegami (www.zegami.com) as a means of easily visualising simulation outputs and statsitics. These collections can be used to see final cell locations for simulations generated from a range of parameter sets, along with statistical summaries and images of spatial statistics (including wPCF(r,P,B) and wPCF(r,P,T) ). Zegami collections can be explored interactively, using a range of different views, some examples of which are linked below.

- Simulations generated by randomly varying 6 parameters ($\chi_{c}^{m}$, $\chi_{\xi}^{m}$, $\chi_{\epsilon}^{T}$, $c_{1/2}$, $P^{\star}$, $g_{crit}$):
