Full wPCF data for all simulations is too large to include here, 
but can be calcuated using the rest of the code in this repository. 

We include in ./Data/ and ./SimulationOutputs/ examples of the .csv files containing the cross-PCFs 
and wPCFs which show the structure of the data expected by the 
script `DoSVMAnalysisToPredictModelBehaviour.py'.
